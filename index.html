        <p> In this case study I observed and interviewed of Coke Freestyle users at 
          Brown University. After analyzing the takeaways from both the observation and interview, 
          created two personas for coke freestyle users. Using one of those personas,
          I created a storyboard describing a personas entire journey as coke freestyle users.

      <p> To gain a more in-depth understanding of Coke Freestyle users, I 
        observed the interactions of 3 users. Following the observations I also 
        interviewed the same three users. The interview questions are listed below.

      <p>Based on these the takeaways described in the user analysis section, 
        I constructed two personas: Decisive Donna and Social Sebastian.</p>
      <h4> Driven Donna:</h4>
      <img src="assets-p&s/DD Empathy Map.png" alt="Empathy Map for Driven Donna">
      <p> More About Donna: 
        <ul>
        <li>Driven Donna's main issue with the interface occurs when either her typical drink of choice is watered down, or
        the interface is causing her to have to spend more time at the machine then normal.</li>
        <li> Donna represents the users who value consistency over variety when using the Coke Freestyle machine. Despite the wide range of drinks available, she prefers to stick to the same one.</li>
        <li> Rather than valuing the machine for its customization features, she appreicates its reliability in delivering her favorite drink - when it works as expected. </li>
        </ul>

     <div id ="block-text">

      <img src="assets-p&s/SS Empathy Map.png" alt="Empathy Map for Social Sebastian">
      <p> More About Sebastian:
          <li> Social Sebastian loves how easy it is to talk to his friends while using the Coke Freestyle machine. Nothing
        about the interface is too confusing where he would have to end his ongoing conversations.He sometimes even lets his friends pick
        his drink when he is in the mood for something new. </li>
        <li> Sebastian represents the users who both like to swtich up their 
          drink choices from time to time and use the machine with friends. Sebastian's 
          interaction with the machine is typically longer than an individual user because he gets distracted by his friends.</li>
