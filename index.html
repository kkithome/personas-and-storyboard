        <p> In this case study I observed and interviewed of Coke Freestyle users at 
          Brown University. After analyzing the takeaways from both the observation and interview, 
          created two personas for coke freestyle users. Using one of those personas,
          I created a storyboard describing a personas entire journey as coke freestyle users.

      <p> To gain a more in-depth understanding of Coke Freestyle users, I 
        observed the interactions of 3 users. Following the observations I also 
        interviewed the same three users. The observations takeaways, interview questions, 
        and summarized responses can be found in the dropdown below. </p>
